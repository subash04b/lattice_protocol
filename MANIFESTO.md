# The Lattice Manifesto: Beyond the Linear Chat

Current AI is a black box. We interact with it through a "Chat Thread"—a linear, fragile stream of tokens. This is a liability for the professional world.

### The Shift
Lattice transitions AI from "Conversation" to "Version-Controlled Reasoning." 

### Our Vision
We believe that every AI-assisted decision should be:
1. **Auditable:** You can see exactly why a path was taken.
2. **Lossless:** Technical intent is never diluted by AI summarization.
3. **Defensible:** A legal and medical "Black Box Recorder" for logic.

**Join the standard. Protect the reasoning.**
