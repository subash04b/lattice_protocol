# Contributing to the Lattice Protocol
We are building the future of AI reasoning integrity. To maintain the 100% win rate of this standard, all contributions must pass the **Lattice Invariant Tests**.

### Our Standards
1. **No Dilution:** We do not accept features that compromise Law II (Preservation).
2. **Technical Rigor:** Every pull request must include a logic-branching diagram.
3. **Security First:** All state-machine transitions must be cryptographically verifiable.

Join the Foundation. Let's build the floor.
